# About Me

Hi, I'm an artist and art therapist who believes in the transformative power of creativity.

## My Practice

I combine my background in **graphic design** and **illustration** with my training as an **art therapist** to create meaningful visual experiences that heal, inspire, and connect.

### What I Do

- **Illustration** — Digital and traditional illustration for books, magazines, and personal projects
- **Art Therapy** — Facilitating creative healing sessions for individuals and groups
- **Workshops** — Teaching creative expression techniques for wellbeing

## My Approach

My work is guided by three core principles:

1. **Authenticity** — Creating from a place of truth and vulnerability
2. **Connection** — Using art to bridge understanding between people
3. **Healing** — Believing that creativity is essential to human wellbeing
